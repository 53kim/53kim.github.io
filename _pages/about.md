I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Data Analytics and Machine Learning](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/) group at the Technical University of Munich, advised by [Stephan Günnemann](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/).

**Research interests**:  So far my focus was on understanding and improving the robustness of machine learning techniques for graph data in the presence of noise and adversaries.
More broadly, I am interested in trustworthy machine learning in general, including aspects such as privacy, fairness, bias, interpretability, and safety.

**Previously**: I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the TU Munich where I worked with Juan Miguel Cejuela at [Rostlab](https://www.rostlab.org/) on extraction of natural language mutation mentions. Before that I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje.
